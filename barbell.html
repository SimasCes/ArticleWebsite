        <p class="article_para">Do you want the lats the size of Ronnie Coleman's? Or how about Jay Cutler? If you don't already know these bodybuilders, they are the mega gods of bodybuilding. And one of their main features is that they have the biggest lats in town. The lats in scientific term are also known as latissimus dorsi. They provide much of the overhead pressing and pulling power. Here's an exercise that you can do in order to build bigger, wider, and thicker lats, starting from the top!
        <br>
        <br>
        Bent-over Barbell Rows: These barbell rows are in fact one of the best exercises you can do to build bigger lats. This exercise is also counted as a compound movement, which hits the whole body nearly. It works the lower back, the deltoids, the chest, your leg muscles, stabilizers, your trap and shoulder muscles, your core/abdominal area, and last but not least, your LATS!
        <br>
        <br>
        How to do this exercise? Plant your feet at about shoulder width apart. Bend over, but keep your back at a natural arch. Don't force your back into an unnatural arch. Doing so will cause serious injury. When you are at this point, position your grip slighter wider than shoulder width apart on the bar. As you grip the bar, tighten your abdomen, and pull the bar up to your upper abdomen or lower chest. Keep in mind, you need to keep your body tight and keep your lower back in a natural arch. Also, make sure you use light enough weights so you can hit 6-8 reps with good form all the way throughout the set. And most of all, don't cheat!
