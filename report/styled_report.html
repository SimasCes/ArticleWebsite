The main story of the website is to get across the message that you can still exercise in any setting. The articles address how you can exercise correctly, or what you should consider, for example why running may actually be worse than walking. It contains articles about health and provides individuals with information they can use to improve their lifestyle. It also goes into diet, which is important for development, as training usually has worse results if it is not accompanies by a healthy diet.  
<br>
<br>
One of the things that inspired me when creating this website was my brother. He is a weight lifter and has a very strict diet (to an extent). I see how much he cares about health and how much he loves training, so this was one inspiration for this topic. Another inspiration was the food pages I follow. Some food pages such as "healthyfoodmag" actually post recipes for sweet food alongside things that are healthy, so itâ€™s not just about having a boring diet, you can mix it up and have some "cheat days". This was important as I wanted the articles (the ones I found so far) to educate or make people think about their decisions, but also so they can enjoy their meals (so later articles could include things that taste good and are healthy). ANother inspiration was that I have a Fitbit. This may be a weirder inspiration, but my Fitbit tells me the steps and distance I walk every day, and sometimes it is very low due to working on my laptop a lot. This means when I see this I try do something more active for a while. This device gives me a little "kick" I would say, and I wanted that from a website. So, reading the articles, such as why it is important to eat lunch, could make you want to eat healthy more often and not skip meals. I also saw that many of the article websites were simple and had a white page, I went for something similar but cream, so it was a bit more appealing. I also say ,any had adverts, and I wanted to add them (so I altered my design) to make my website look more realistic (the adverts are not active however). In the future, I might try incorporate the search bar onto the main page, but otherwise I am quite happy with how the deign turned out.
<br>
<br>
One way in which my site is accessible is, that each image has an alt attribute. This alt attribute specifies what the image shows, so someone blind could still imagine what the image shows. Another feature is that I used semantics to structure my pages. I used aside, footer, main, article and a few more. This means screen readers would find it easier to navigate the website. I have also used values such as vw and headings in my site. This means the text will re-size with each device, meaning everyone should be able to read the text, whichever device they use.
<br>
<br>
The 1st thing I did to consider usability is make my web-page easy to navigate. The navigation bar can take you to any pages you need to access and there is a photo library on the home page, which again if you click on the different images, takes you to the different sections (there are words on it so you know which section to go to). I have also decided to add a search page, meaning the articles you are looking for are easier to find (which would be very useful, especially if there were many articles). I also considered usability in my design stage, editing my design if it was not appealing to the eye and chose my design to be simple, so it is not confusing. The look of the website was made with non-intensive colours (there is a yellow colour used but it is dulled down so it is more honey) and they are not eye-straining, so you can stay on the site for a longer time. I have also made the article links be on the images, descriptions, and titles; so, it is easier to get to the article you want to go to (especially for phone users).  
<br>
<br>
I wanted to know the full capabilities of HTML and CSS before starting. So, using the W3Schools website I actually went through almost every single command that HTML and CSS have. I made a "cheat-sheet" in a text editor for easy access, so I could find the commands I learnt about. In this way I found out about how to use vw values instead of px, how to make images not be stretched but fit to the box instead, and many other useful commands and tricks. I also used W3Schools, alongside CSS-Tricks, and alligator.io to find out more about how the flex-box works. I then used https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp code to make my own flexbox (cited at the bottom). I changed this code quite a bit, but it helped me understand more about how to create a responsive page. I used a range of online learning resources to lean the JavaScript code. I was able to edit some and write my own code due to my other modules, but the links to where I used some code from are linked on here and on the .js sheet.
<br>
<br>
I think one aspect that worked well is the flex-box. It allows the website to be responsive, and when the viewport is small, the website collapses gracefully, and in my opinion still looks good. Furthermore, using vw values and using headings helps make text readable on smaller or bigger devices. The image carousel on the front page also works well, as the other pages are linked to it, I think that makes it smoother to navigate. Linking the article names, images, and descriptions to that actual article page also helps access the articles with more ease (like the articles on the home page, you can click the image, red more, description, date, and title; to access the full article). Lastly, I made the top navigation sticky, so you can always go to the section you need to. I also tried to make all the commands work on safari, and it seems to have worked well.
<br>
<br>
I think I would like to improve the use of JavaScript next time, as this time it was quite difficult understanding how to use it. I managed to get things working but it took quite a long time. I have a 'personalised' box on the front page, however after you re-load it forgets your name. I couldn't figure out how to add cookies, so I would like to learn how to do that. Lastly, I had to update my design as I was missing things, next time it would be better if I spent a bit longer on that aspect before starting to code (however it was not too difficult to add the extra features).

All the wireframes, mockups, adn site-maps are in a report_images folder. They are numbered 1-14 + the validator, and that is the order of how the design developed.
<br>
<br>
The report images did not style so you will have to go into the report_images folder to find them.
