        <p class="article_para">Most of us are busy, busy, busy and often say that we don't have time to stop for lunch. While we do tend to be busy, is simply not stopping for lunch making us more busy? What do I mean?
        <br>
        <br>
        Well, sitting at our desk and not stopping for lunch or for any type of break may just be making us less effective in our work and our life in general.
        <br>
        <br>
        One of the problems with not stopping for lunch is that we tend to eat on the fly and eat without really considering what we are eating. By stopping for lunch and having a break, we deliberately set aside time to eat, usually choose better options (because we're not limited to easy to eat with one hand foods), we have a break to refresh and regather our thoughts and often come back to our tasks with a greater clarity and fresh approach.
        <br>
        <br>
        By simply stopping for lunch, we can implement a way of reducing stress in the workplace. Stopping to give yourself a break and time away from the task you were performing allows you to change your focus and think about something else, and relieve some stress.
        <br>
        <br>
        As suggested above, stopping for lunch can improve your productivity. After a break you often come at the task from a fresh angle and tend to be more effective in the way you approach a problem, thus increasing your productivity. When focussing on a task for a long period of time without a break, your approach can get stale and you might not see errors or opportunities to progress the solution to the task you're working on. So, by stopping for lunch you just might return to your desk and find that solution you've been looking for.

        Mindless eating, particularly at our desk without any real consideration of what we are eating, is a sure fire way to ensure that we consume much more than we are aware of and usually not choices that would be of good nutritional value. Stopping for lunch and being more mindful with our eating allows us to fuel our nutritional needs more appropriately for the tasks that lie ahead of us for the remainder of the day.

        Stopping for lunch will also increase your incidental activity but simply moving to a different location, for example the lunchroom. Stopping for lunch also gives you the opportunity to not only stop and eat your lunch but also partake in some exercise. Many people like to go for a walk or visit a nearby gym to clear their head and refresh them in their lunch break. Simply walking up and down the stairs in your building or up and down some corridors in the building will increase your incidental activity and productivity too, if getting outdoors or to the gym is not a possibility. Going for a run or jog around the nearby area may also be an option near you.
        <br>
        <br>
        Relationships in the offices are often improved by stopping for lunch also. Meeting at the lunchroom or a park bench in a nearby park, allows you to mix with colleagues over a meal and get to know them outside work related tasks. This often helps build better working relationships and an ability to work better together on work related tasks.

        Stopping for lunch gives you something to look forward to during the day, especially if you have packed something great for lunch. Looking forward to a break will make that time just before the break more effective and more creative.

        Remember, that we tend to be able to find time to walk and find a good coffee shop nearby to purchase our coffee or slip outside for a cigarette, but why is it we find it difficult to stop for lunch? When we have a meeting over lunch at a local restaurant or caf√© we tend to be far more effective and productive in the lead up to that lunch knowing we'll be out of the office for a little while, why can't we think like that everyday and make stopping for lunch a priority?
