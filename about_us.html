        <h1>Our Idea</h1>
        <h2>We believe everyone exercises for different reasons. You may do it to gain muscle, loose wight, gain core strength, or a range of other reasons. Whatever that reason is, you can still exercise in any setting, whether that be a busy city, or an urban neighbourhood. This website was created to collect articles for the purpose of training. It keeps up with top stories in cardio and weight, but also gives insights of the diet as this is an important step. We believe information like this should be easily accessible, so we collect it, and put it in one place, making it is easy for the daily person to access and use.</h2>
