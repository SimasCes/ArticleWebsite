        All types of salmon are good sources of omega-3 containing only 75 milligrams of cholesterol. While fresh salmon is low in sodium, it varies with canned or smoked salmon. For example, canned pink salmon can have 554 milligrams of sodium.
        <br>
        <br>
        Salmon steaks and fillets can be broiled, grilled, poached, sauted, steamed and baked. A lemony or lime-based marinade can create a unique flavor. Cold, cooked salmon and canned salmon can be used as a substitute for meat in hamburgers and patties, in cold salads and mousses.
        <br>
        <br>
        If salmon has previously been frozen when purchased, it should not be frozen again.

        There are six major salmon species, one from the Atlantic Ocean and the others from the Pacific Coast. The differences between the species are:
        <br>
        <br>
        Atlantic salmon can be wild or farm-raised and may be marketed according to its source, for example Norwegian or Icelandic. It is a rich tasting fish, red or orange when it is raw and turning pink when cooked. The flesh is somewhat softer than other species.
        <br>
        <br>
        Chinook salmon is marketed by where it was caught. It is an oily fish, relatively soft and red in color.
        <br>
        <br>
        Coho salmon is sometimes called silver salmon and is medium red in color. It is less oily and turns orange or pink when cooked.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sockeye salmon is prized for its deep-red flesh. It is sometimes labeled as blueback salmon.
        <br>
        <br>
        Chum salmon may also be called silverbrites and semibrites. The flesh is on the orange side and it is lighter in both color and taste than other Pacific types. Most chum is sold frozen or canned. It tends to turn pink or gray when cooked.
        <br>
        <br>
        Pink salmon are the smallest of the species and sometimes called "humpies." The flesh is softer and pinker compared to the other species of salmon. It can sometimes be found fresh but most pink salmon is canned.
        <br>
        <br>
        Methods of cooking salmon:
        <br>
        <br>
        Burgers are usually made using canned salmon mixed with uncooked oatmeal, chopped onion and an egg. To add flavor, lemon juice or bottled horseradish can be added. The burgers should be cooked until a brown crust is formed on both sides.
        <br>
        <br>
        Poaching salmon in bouillon and then covering it with a lemony dill sauce makes an excellent entree. The salmon is put, skin side down, in a large skillet and slowly boiled in the liquid until done, then allowed to sit for a short time. The final touch is a sprinkling of paprika over the salmon before serving.
        <br>
        <br>
        Broiled salmon flavor is highlighted by using a marinade of Dijon mustard, lime juice, and tarragon. For a sweeter taste, honey can be added. It should be placed on a rack, skin side down and cooked in a preheated broiler which has been coated with a nonstick spray. The marinade is then spooned over the salmon.
        <br>
        <br>
        Salmon is highly rated nutritionally because of its high concentration and the benefits of the seven different omega-3 fatty acid it contains.
