# ArticleWebsite

The assignment was to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website. It was the first website I created and it was to create an article website. Mine revolved around helthy eating/exercise. I also encorporated a search bar for the articles. You can find the website on https://simasces.github.io/ArticleWebsite/
